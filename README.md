<p>The Odin Project is one of those "What I wish I had when I was learning" resources.<br>
  Not everyone has access to a computer science education or the funds to attend an intensive coding school and neither of those is right for everyone anyway.<br>
  This project is designed to fill in the gap for people who are trying to hack it on their own but still want a high quality education.</p>
