    <h1>Beer marinated pork</h1>
        <p>the Viking diet doesn't consist of much meat.
            Cows, sheep and horses were mainly kept for their milk, wool just as they served as labour and means of transport.<br>
            As it was difficult to do without these animals, it was quite rare that they would be slaughtered.<br>
            However, when it did happen, the farmer knew how to get the most out of the animals and made use of everything, like e.g. the bones, skins and horns.<br>       
            the pig was the only domestic animal kept just for the meat</p>
