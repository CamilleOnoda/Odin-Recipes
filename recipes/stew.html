        <h1>Stove-top Stew</h1>
            <p>It is the ultimate one pot meal that would have kept going all week.<br>
            Traditionally it would have made use of what was obtainable at the time<br>and would have been added to as the week went on.<br>
            If there was any meat available, most likely a rabbit, this would have been chucked in too.</p>

                    <li>Heat the butter/oil in a large stock pot/Dutch oven over a  low-medium flame.</li>
                    <li>Once the oil is warm, add the sliced/diced onions, leeks and celery to the pot and stir before covering over with the lid to soften for approx ten minutes.</li>
                    <li>Then add the chopped root vegetables, stir and leave for a few minutes to soften and take on the flavour of the onions and leeks.</li>
                    <li>Add at least enough water to cover the vegetables, more if you want to thin it out and make it go further, increase the heat and bring to the boil.</li>
                    <li>Thenc reduce the heat so it is just simmering and add the oats to thicken and herbs for flavour. Top up with more water if necessary.</li>
                    <li>Leave to  simmer for about an hour, then taste!  </li>
